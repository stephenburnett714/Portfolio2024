            I am an inquisitive and diligent software engineer who has over six
            years of consulting experience. I have a passion for problem solving
            and learning. Consulting has taught me to live in a growth mindset
            where I strive to be better everyday. Working as a business analyst
            at Navitas Billing ignited my enthusiasm for coding and ultimately
            led me to pursue a career change.
